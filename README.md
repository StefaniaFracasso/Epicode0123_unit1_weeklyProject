<h2>Complete Layout HTML + CSS</h2>
<p>The project to be carried out summarizes all the skills acquired so far, and requires the complete layout from scratch (creating HTML first and then CSS) of a web page in mobile version first, and desktop version later. The mobile layout will have to be tested on small screens (up to 450px-500px), the desktop one must display correctly on a size between 1366px and 1920px in width.</p>
